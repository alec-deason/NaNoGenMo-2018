Ok. Here's a project for National Novel Generation Month 2018.

The idea is that I will do generation in three stages:

* A very crude simulation of a world with independent agents. Basically an
old-school text adventure game with autonomous NPCs playing it. Record a
stream of events for each agent so I know their life history.


* Examine the life histories of all the agents and pick one that is
"interesting" somehow. Not sure what exactly that means. Some sort of function
that judges how good the agent's story is. Likely just pick stories that
contain low probability events at first.

  * Probably need to refine the story a bit to add in enough details to make it 
tellable.

* Magic? Somehow turn the chosen event stream into prose text. I'm honestly less
interested in this part so if I can get to the point where I'm templating out
a boring, stiff narration of the agent's story but the story itself __would__
be interesting if it were written well then I'm going to call that a
resounding success.
